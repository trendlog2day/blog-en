If you were watching the Chicago Bears take on the Los Angeles Rams, you likely noticed a massive voice taking center stage before kickoff. That distinct, operatic power usually belongs to one man, and his appearance at this game has generated quite a bit of search traffic. I dug into the details to confirm who was holding the microphone and why it matters.

## The Jim Cornelison National Anthem Bears Rams Connection

When big matchups happen, fans invariably ask who will handle the Star-Spangled Banner. For the Bears vs. Rams Divisional Playoff game, the spotlight fell on Jim Cornelison. His rendition is known for its intensity, and according to reports, NBC made the specific decision to broadcast his performance live.

This is significant because networks often skip the anthem for commercial breaks during standard broadcasts. However, given the profile of this playoff game—and Cornelison's reputation—the decision was made to show it. If you watched the broadcast, you saw exactly why he is a local legend.

## Who Is Jim Cornelison?

If you aren't from Chicago, you might be wondering about the man behind the voice. Jim Cornelison is an operatically trained tenor who has become synonymous with Chicago sports. While he is most famous for his full-time role singing the anthem for the Chicago Blackhawks—where the tradition involves fans cheering loudly throughout the entire song—he is a frequent guest at Soldier Field.

A look at the Jim Cornelison biography shows he graduated from the master's program in opera performance at Indiana University. That training explains why he doesn't just sing the song; he projects it with incredible force, even in an open-air stadium.

### Can You See Him Again?

Many fans immediately look for the Jim Cornelison Bears national anthem schedule after hearing him sing. The Bears don't always publish the anthem singer schedule far in advance for the public, but checking the team’s official social media channels is reliable, though for this playoff matchup, Cornelison confirmed the news himself on X (formerly Twitter) the Tuesday prior to the game.

On a side note, I found it interesting that he isn't limited to stadiums. If you have ever searched for how to hire Jim Cornelison, he actually performs at private corporate events and weddings. You can book him directly through his website if you want that kind of power at your own event.
