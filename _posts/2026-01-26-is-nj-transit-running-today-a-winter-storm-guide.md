# Is NJ Transit Running Today? A Winter Storm Guide

Snow and ice on the ground usually lead to immediate panic about the morning commute. If you are asking, "Is NJ Transit running today?" you definitely aren't the only one scrambling for information. I dug into how the system typically handles these heavy weather events to help you decide if you should head to the station or stay put. ❄️

## Checking for NJ Transit Service Alerts

The first thing I always tell people is not to assume the trains are running on a normal schedule just because the snow hasn't piled up high yet. NJ Transit often issues a **travel advisory** before the worst weather hits.

I researched their standard operating procedures, and they usually operate on a few different levels during storms:

*   **Cross-Honoring:** This is the most common first step. It means your train ticket will work on buses, light rail, and sometimes private bus carriers. It gives you options if one mode of transport goes down.
*   **Severe Weather Schedule:** This is where it gets tricky. If they declare a **Level 1** severe weather schedule, the service typically mirrors a **weekend schedule**. Unlike the bus or Access Link systems, which may have intermediate restrictions, rail service usually operates on this modified schedule until conditions force a full **systemwide suspension**.

## Potential NJ Transit Winter Storm Delays

Even if the app says service is "active," you need to be prepared for delays. Cold weather wreaks havoc on the infrastructure. Switches freeze, overhead wires contract or get weighed down by ice, and signals malfunction.

Honestly, it's a bit complicated because a train might leave the first station on time but get stuck behind a frozen switch halfway through the trip. I have found that checking **DepartureVision** online is often more accurate than the printed schedule during these times.

### Where to Find Real-Time Info

If you want the absolute latest status on schedule changes caused by winter weather, go straight to the source rather than general news outlets:

*   **The NJ TRANSIT Mobile App:** Usually pushes the fastest alerts regarding line suspensions.
*   **Social Media:** Their specific line accounts (like **@NJTRANSIT_NEC**) are often updated by dispatchers with specific delay reasons.

## Related News Resources

*   Check local news outlets for updates on State of Emergency declarations.
*   Monitor major airport statuses (EWR/JFK) as flight cancellations often correlate with transit disruptions.

If you see a travel ban or a heavy advisory in place, the smartest move is usually to wait it out. Delays can turn a one-hour trip into a four-hour ordeal when ice is involved. Stay warm and check that app one last time before you walk out the door.
