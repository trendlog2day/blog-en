If you have been following the Pittsburgh Steelers for any length of time, you know Mike Tomlin as the stoic, focused face on the sidelines. But when the headset comes off, many fans find themselves wondering about his life away from the gridiron. Specifically, people often ask: who is Mike Tomlin married to?

I looked into this because, unlike many NFL spouses who seek the spotlight, Tomlin’s wife has built a massive reputation of her own, completely separate from football. Here is the story of the woman standing beside one of the NFL’s most recognizable coaches.

## Meet Kiya Winston Tomlin

The short answer is that Mike Tomlin is married to **Kiya Winston** (now Kiya Tomlin). They have been together since long before the Super Bowl rings and the high-pressure press conferences.

Kiya isn't just a supporting character in Mike's story; she is a powerhouse in her own right. While Mike commands the locker room, Kiya has carved out a unique space in the fashion industry. 

## A Successful Career in Fashion

When I researched Mike Tomlin's wife and her career, I was honestly impressed by her portfolio. She is a successful fashion designer with her own brand, simply called *Kiya Tomlin*.

Her design philosophy is actually pretty brilliant. She focuses on high-end, comfortable clothing—think "sweatsuits that look like evening wear." She often talks about designing for the modern woman who needs to look polished but wants to feel comfortable. It makes sense when you consider she spends a lot of time traveling and sitting in stadiums.

She has a flagship store and a manufacturing studio in Etna, Pennsylvania. It’s worth mentioning that she didn’t just stumble into this; she has a background in design and has been running her business professionally for years. ✨

## How Did Mike Tomlin Meet His Wife?

Their love story goes back way further than his coaching days. Mike and Kiya met when they were both students at **The College of William & Mary** in Virginia.

It’s a classic college romance story. Mike was a wide receiver for the football team, and Kiya was a gymnast. I found it interesting that Kiya was actually a pre-med student at first before she pivoted to follow her passion for design. They got married in 1996, which means they have navigated the ups and downs of a grueling NFL coaching career together for decades.

## The Tomlin Family Unit

Together, the couple has three children: sons Dean and Mason, and daughter Harlyn. Staying true to their parents' athletic roots, the kids have been involved in sports as well, with the boys having played college football.

What stands out when you look at their relationship is the partnership. Mike has frequently credited Kiya for managing the home front and supporting his intense schedule, while he is often seen front and center supporting her fashion shows and business ventures.

## The Bottom Line

So, when you ask who Mike Tomlin is married to, the answer is a successful entrepreneur and fashion designer who has been with him since the very beginning. Kiya Tomlin has managed to build her own empire while supporting one of the most demanding careers in sports. It is a partnership that seems grounded in their shared history at William & Mary and a mutual respect for each other's grind.
