If you are scrambling to find the exact **Marvel Rivals Season 6 release time (Deadpool edition)**, you aren't the only one. With the hype surrounding the Merc with a Mouth finally joining the roster, figuring out exactly when the servers go live across different time zones can be a bit of a headache.

I looked into the launch schedule and downtime details to help you figure out exactly when you can start playing.

## When Does Marvel Rivals Season 6 Start?

The biggest question right now is simply: **when does Marvel Rivals Season 6 start**? Based on the standard patch rollouts we've seen from NetEase, the update follows a global release schedule. This means everyone gets access at the same moment.

**Marvel Rivals Season 6 officially begins at 9:00 AM UTC on January 16, 2026.**

For players in the US, this translates to:
*   **4:00 AM EST**
*   **1:00 AM PST**

Here is what you need to keep an eye on regarding the **Marvel Rivals Season 6 start time**:

*   **Server Maintenance:** Updates typically require a maintenance window (usually 2 hours) before the new content is playable.
*   **Platform Sync:** Whether you are on PC or console, the release time generally aligns across all platforms to ensure cross-play features work immediately.

If you try to log in and get a "maintenance" error, don't panic. That just means the **Marvel Rivals Deadpool Season release time** is approaching and the developers are finalizing the patch deployment.

## Deadpool: The Rule-Breaking Update

Honestly, the release time isn't the only thing unique about this season. I was reading through the patch notes, and the way they are handling Deadpool is wild. According to reports, he isn't sticking to one role. He is officially joining as a Duelist, a Strategist, *and* a Vanguard.

This makes the **Marvel Rivals Season 6 release time (Deadpool)** even more significant because it could fundamentally change the meta. You aren't just waiting for a new DPS character; you're waiting for a character that seemingly defies the game's class system entirely. 🌮

## Marvel Rivals Season 6 Downtime

Before the fun starts, we have to deal with the wait. **Marvel Rivals Season 6 downtime** is a necessary evil. I found that downtime usually begins a few hours before the official start time.

During this window:
1.  You will be disconnected from ongoing matches.
2.  The game client will need to download the Season 6 patch.
3.  Server stability checks are performed.

It is smart to have your auto-updates turned on so the moment the **Marvel Rivals Season 6 release time for Deadpool** hits, your game is already patched and ready to launch.
